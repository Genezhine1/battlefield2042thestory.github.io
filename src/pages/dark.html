<p>In August, 2048, the public rumors and witness of the disappearances of <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="prologue_nopat">No-Pats</span> across the globe had started to reach a boiling point. The <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="epilogue_erf">ERF</span>, previously neglecting these disappearances, launched an investigation into the matter after cancellation of combat contracts were threatened. The public knew of this ongoing investigation as news anchors around the world were reporting on the events.</p>
<p>Subsequently <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span> had picked up on these rumors and sent out broadcasts on the No-Pat News Network regarding the disappearances.</p>

<p><em>I want to address the shocking revelations that have come to light regarding the multiple cases of missing No-Pats.</em></p>
<p><em>The disturbing evidence I have seen leads me to believe there may be some truth to these accounts. That is why I am using every available resource to launch our own investigation into this matter.</em></p>
<p><em>I promise you, any No-Pat missing will be found and brought home safely. I have another promise for those responsible for this heinous act - you will be found, and you will be punished. <br>- Oz</em></p>
</ul>
<p><span class='highlightDark' tooltip="epilogue_arkangel">Arkangel</span> knew they had to come up with a solution and to maintain their anonymity from the disappearances - they officially launched the <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dark_nri">No-Pat Recovery Initiative</span>. By working with governments the world over, the NRI would collect information on the missing No-Pat cases, and promise the families of those impacted that they would be there for them to work together.</p>
<p>After <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dawn_tombstone">Tombstone Squad</span>’s deployment in <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dawn_reclaimed">Czechia</span>, they caught wind of the Royal Highland Biohazard Detail’s, RHBD, latest <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dark_opdecaying">Operation: Decaying Element</span>. The operation was carried out after reports of an abandoned vessel off the coast of Scotland stated it was contaminated by hazardous material. <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="zero_falck">Falck</span>, leading <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="zero_boris">Boris</span>, <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="zero_casper">Casper</span> and <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="zero_dozer">Dozer</span>, decided to continue the chase of these breadcrumbs - which started in Czechia - in hopes of finding more answers about her son.</p>
<p>They arrived in Scotland and boarded the vessel only to find the place had been turned upside down. After some scanning they found blood samples linking to a No-Pat that had gone missing six months prior. Her name was <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dark_zekkal">Leila Zekkal</span> and had been transported, along with other No-Pats, on this cargo ship to <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="epilogue_boreas">Boreas</span>.</p>
<p>Leila Zekkal, of Algerian heritage, aligned herself with the No-Pat movement back in 2044 after being inspired by the victory at the <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="eleven_flashpoint">Richtersveld</span>. Years later during a Shearwater-2 rollout in Sudan, which caused a devastating event, she was captured and sent to the Boreas lab where she would go through horrific treatment as her identity was stripped away - now called 8838. Anger would start to brew and she started working with like minded No-Pats to form an alliance and a plan to finally break free - they would strike when the time was right.</p>
<p>In September, 2048 at 4:00, <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="zero_paik">Paik</span> managed to bait out an extraction team, after weeks of trial and error, from Boreas. Approximately six hours later they reached the <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="epilogue_redacted">Scottish Hebrides</span> where Paik was put in line with other fellow No-Pats to go through processing. <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dawn_valkyrie">Valkyrie</span> had informed Paik there would be a bag waiting for her inside the lab containing a <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="epilogue_bcs">BCS</span> suit, a pistol and a lab ID - she went undercover. Now she only needed to survive long enough until <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="prologue_irish">Irish</span> and the others realized what was taking place.</p>
<p>Paik, with the help of her equipment, slipped by unnoticed inside the lab. She made her way to the server room, silently eliminating whoever stood in her way, and turned to the consoles. There she would commence her plan of collecting data - data that would find itself in Valkyrie’s hands as Tombstone collects it for her later on.</p>
<p>The synthetics in the Boreas lab had started rebelling during testing scenarios, which <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="epilogue_aos">A.O.S</span> was directly responsible for, for some time now. This had sparked concerns in leadership but before they managed to isolate and shut down these rogue synthetics a subsequent rebellion from the test subjects complicated the procedure. A group of augmented No-Pat prisoners, calling themselves <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dark_unit86">Unit 86</span> and led by Leila Zekkal, were responsible.</p>
<p>As the rebellion unfolds an Eastern spy, who had just discovered the facility, managed to send a message to his superiors revealing the lab’s location. Shortly thereafter the spy was captured and executed. <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="epilogue_blackburn">Blackburn</span> caught notice of this and ordered for the lab to be shut down and all evidence to be eradicated. But it didn’t work. They managed to perform an emergency lockdown with the rebellion still contained inside. Blackburn, desperate for cover, leaks the location and intel of a deceased Eastern spy to the US in hopes of sparking a conflict at the lab so he can send in a crew to finish the clean-up.</p>
<p>His knowledge of the famed Exodus No-Pats led him to recruit Irish, <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="zero_mackay">Mackay</span> and <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="prologue_lis">Lis</span> to form <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dark_gambit">Gambit Squad</span>. Their orders were to cleanse the site of any evidence connecting Arkangel&#39;s role in Boreas’ operations. Irish accepted as he had had contact with Falck previously about the suspicions regarding Arkangel, in hopes of finding answers. After deploying into the Boreas lab, seemingly abandoned, it didn’t take long until they had a surprise meetup with Paik.</p>
<p>Paik told them everything about her reason for being present at the lab and encouraged Gambit to disregard their orders - something bigger was at play here. Gambit Squad, now taking on an unofficial teammate, scoured the lab and copied all records before purging it triggering an alarm in the process. The alarm had prompted Unit 86 to come out of hiding but also notified A.O.S, still present and active, of intruders as they unleashed hordes of synthetics, <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dark_geist">Geists</span>, on the specialists.</p>
<p>After battling the horde for a while, moving deeper into the lab, Unit 86 arrived to support the fireteam. They managed to escape from A.O.S’ sight as they returned to Unit 86’s hideout. Irish wanted to expose Arkangel after finding out the truth but Paik proposed patience - Valkyrie had a plan. Irish contacted Blackburn shortly thereafter:</p>
<ul>
<p><em>It’s done, the site’s purged. <br>- Irish</em></p>
<p><em>I knew the famed Exodus No-Pats wouldn’t let me down. The future is in both of our hands now. <br>- Blackburn</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Since Blackburn still had eyes on A.O.S, who had taken notice of Gambit’s records collecting, he knew of their possession of the data but hoped it would stay sealed.</p>
<p>Subsequently, with Unit 86 and Gambit still present in the lab, Blackburn sends in <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="dark_ascension">Ascension Company</span>, Arkangel’s private security forces, to finish the work and contain the geist outbreak using master kill switches. A.O.S cunningly manages to trick some of the arriving special forces as she hacked into their comms, emulating the commander’s voice, giving them altered orders. This sparked a clash between the forces, complicating the planned killswitch.</p>
<p>Gambit Squad and Unit 86’s next goal is to escape. Complications arise and they discover that Unit 86’s survival depend on the assets and tools present at the lab - without them they cannot survive - their fate is uncertain.</p>
<p>In November 2048, after the prior events, the public started picking up on the catastrophe in the Scottish Hebrides as news anchors around the world started getting reports of its dealings. Subsequently, Oz receives communication from Leila Zekkal, 8838, revealing Boreas’ kidnapping and experimentation on No-Pats. Oz exposes these news to the public:</p>

<p><em>Our investigation into the missing No-Pats has revealed a truth more shocking than I could’ve imagined. After receiving communication from someone calling themselves 8-8-3-8, I can confirm a secret Boreas laboratory has been kidnapping No-Pats and holding them prisoner for brutal experimentation.</em></p>
<p><em>While the trauma has robbed 8838 of all memory, we believe her name to be Leila Zekkal. Thanks to her, we now have a chance to bring everyone home.</em></p>
<p><em>As for Arkangel, I hope for their sake an investigation proves Boreas acted independently. <br>- Oz</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Following this, the chaos and unplanned exposure at the Boreas R&D lab, Arkangel moves into full damage control as Blackburn leads a public objective to cover up their involvement in the catastrophe. Across multiple channels around the world, Arkangel Public Network, broadcasts:</p>

<p><em>The capture, imprisonment, and torture of No-Pats at the Boreas Hebrides Laboratory was a monstrous crime against humanity.</em></p>
<p><em>I am horrified by the actions of Eric Nilsson and Captain Campbell, who sanctioned and participated in these atrocities. The relevant authorities have my full cooperation to ensure that all those responsible are swiftly brought to justice.</em></p>
<p><em>No apology will fix the unspeakable tragedy that has taken place. But I pledge this: with the progress made on our synthetic soldier program, we will soon save the lives of No-Pats everywhere, replacing them on the battlefield. <br>- Blackburn</em></p>
</ul>
<p>By throwing both Erik Nilsson and <span class='highlightDark' tooltip="epilogue_campbell">Captain Campbell</span> under the bus he steers clear of any wrongdoings in the public’s eye.</p>
<p>In December 2048, Blackburn ensured the Arkangel Board of Directors, regarding their concerns following the Boreas incident, that it has been fully dealt with and they are in the clear. As BCS had regained full control of the facility, Ascension Company managed to contain A.O.S in an enclosure - so he told the Board.</p>

<p><em>I am aware of the board’s concerns regarding the unfortunate incident at the Boreas Hebrides laboratory. But I can assure you this matter is in hand. BCS units have regained control of the facility and a clean-up operation is underway. Any connection to Arkangel will be thoroughly eradicated.</em></p>
<p><em>As for AOS, she poses no threat to our operations. Ascension Company has contained the asset inside a restricted access enclosure where she is undergoing invasive reprogramming. All operations will continue at full pace. <br>- Blackburn</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Blackburn’s goals in creating a future of synthetic armies continue, but his endgame is yet to be revealed. Valkyrie, now having contacted Gambit Squad, orders them to follow her next steps - the future depends on it.</p>

<p><em>Arkangel managed to wipe all the blood from the Boreas lab off their hands. Not that I’m surprised.</em></p>
<p><em>But you and I know it’s all connected. The No-Pat experiments. Unshackled A.I. Blackburn’s funding the program from start to finish.</em></p>
<p><em>But I haven’t figured out his endgame yet. That’s where you come in. <br>- Valkyrie</em></p>
