<p>All the way back in 2042 a team based in Cape Town reported on <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="prologue_nopat">No-Pat</span> activity in the <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_flashpoint">Richtersveld</span> and were building a camp outside the <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_wellspring">Wellspring wreckage</span> which was receiving reinforcements, sent by <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span>, arriving from the Orange River.</p>
<p>In October, 2043, the Impávido arrives in <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="escalation_breakaway">Queen Maud land</span> to escort <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="prologue_exodus">The Exodus</span> to <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_namaqualand">Namaqualand</span>, named by <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span> as he was born in one of the Nama villages there, and <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="prologue_irish">Irish</span> proceeds to board the Impávido and converse with its captain, <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="master_blasco">Blasco</span>. Irish thanks her for their aid in <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="zero_stranded">Panama</span> but she still isn’t fully allied as doubts about Oz and concerns of his methods are still afloat. Blasco notices the damaged hull of The Exodus and decides to escort them to the Richtersveld.</p>
<p><span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="zero_wolff">Wolff</span> knew of these dealings as he had spies placed on the Impávido. This would later serve him well as he could pinpoint the location of Oz and his base and commence <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_curtain">Operation: Curtain Call</span>.</p>
<p>On October 30th, 2043 at 3:00, Camila Blasco executed a S\&amp;D mission to take down the secret US based bunker in <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_capetown">Cape Town</span>, acting as safehouse for military personnel. Her motive was to stop the emergence of spies from boarding her ship. The personnel at Cape Town were directly working to spy on the nearby Richtersveld where Oz and his No-Pats were transporting material into the abandoned Wellspring rocket fuel facility. Wolff noted that the facility was not being used to create the Shearwater-2 satellite but instead they were building a fortified base. Blasco succeeded in her mission in eliminating the personell on-site.</p>
<p>Wolff’s discovery of the Wellspring base and Dir, Renoit’s eventual assurance of access to almost limitless resources put him in a significant military advantage, or so he thought, and Operation: Curtain Call ensued.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Exodus No-Pats were ordered by Blasco to reveal the truth about Wolff and America to the world – and in conducting a test of Shearwater-2 on a remote location, as a precaution if it were to fail.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>The only way we ensure the No Pats’ survival is if we neutralize Wolff. A long time ago, Oz collected intel proving the United States’ role in the Blackout. If we release it, we sabotage Wolff’s operation. An associate here has kept that intel safe for Oz. <br>- Blasco</em></p>
</ul>
<p>The intel had been kept safe by an associate in <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_discarded">Alang, India</span> and Blasco sent The Exodus to the site. As they reach Alang they receive a message revealing the exact dropsite of the intel left by the associate. They were being watched. The dropsite was in the Richtersveld and The Exodus No-Pats collected it. Blasco then tells them to find a way to broadcast it globally.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>Contact made – they were watching us. Like a specter in shadow. That message reveals the dropsite where the associate left the intel. Once we locate it, and broadcast globally… everyone will know America’s role in causing the Blackout.</em></p>
<p><em>After we release the intel, Wolff will be made the scapegoat. With Wolff tied up in bureaucratic red tape and paperwork, the No-Pats will have their chance at survival. Find a way to broadcast the intel. <br>- Blasco</em></p>
</ul>
<p>The Exodus No-Pats transmit the broadcast using a comms device in the Wellspring base. Now all they could do is wait for the world to finally hear the truth.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>Broadcast transmitting… Deep breaths, No Pats: You did it. Now we wait as the intel spreads. The whole world will finally know the truth, and Wolff will be finished. Oz’s new world has a chance. Change will take time, and our home won’t be built in a day, but rest assured, a new dawn is breaking for all No Pats. <br>- Blasco</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Following this, Oz knew of the emerging threat on the Richtersveld and broadcasted <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_ozspeech">his speech</span> across all No-Pat frequencies with a plea to join the cause and fight for their future. This speech mentions the exposure of America’s involvement in the <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="prologue_blackout">Blackout</span>, conducted by the Exodus No-Pats.</p>
<p>On November 11th, 2043 at 9:00, Wolff’s elite strike team, the Foreign Activities Liaison Team, <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_falt">FALT</span>, infiltrated the Wellspring base. Wolff managed to locate Oz with the help of satellite navigation and relayed the coordinates to FALT squad Chaser who then moved on to the first target but he was not found. They moved to a different target shortly thereafter and successfully laid eyes on Oz. Wolff orders Chaser to open fire and it results in 5 KIAs but Oz escapes with the help of a smoke bomb, but is hurt. Chaser proceeds to collect intel and data on the people there as Wolff sends new coordinates on Oz’s location and Chaser pursues.</p>
<p>Chaser squad clashes with Oz again but is ultimately overpowered by his <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_silvermilitia">Silver Spear militia</span>. The operation failed but the Battle of the Richtersveld continues as US backed No-Pats deployed on one side, to seize the rocket fuel facility, and Russian backed No-Pats on the other side, to take Oz dead or alive and amidst them all were No-Pats rallying to Oz’s cause.</p>
<p>Before the battle, the Exodus No-Pats were remotely ordered by Blasco to conduct the <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_shearwater2">test of the Shearwater-2 satellite</span> in <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_renewal">Egypt</span>. So on November 15th, 2043, they arrived in Egypt and conducted the test and it succeeded: forming a superstorm.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>Before we use Shearwater-2 in South Africa, Oz wants to see a test trial. We can’t risk a blackout on the No-Pats’ new homeland. Activate the satellite and see if it works, Exodus. Let’s make a superstorm. <br>- Blasco</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Blasco was caught by surprise and could now see Oz’s promised future.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>Son of a bitch, it worked! It actually worked! This… could change everything. Yes, Oz can use it to create a home for all No Pats, but we will be able to do so much more. We could tame the superstorms. Fix the environment… Fix the world. <br>- Blasco</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently, Blasco deploys on the battlefield in Richtersveld with her <span class='highlightEleven' tooltip="eleven_leviathan">Leviathan Division</span> task force to turn the tide of the battle in their favor. The Battle of the Richtersveld was won by Oz’s No-Pat forces and the US and Russian forces dispersed. Wolff paid for his failures as he was decommissioned from the CIA and he exiled himself.</p>
<p>The Shearwater-2 satellite was now ready to be used on the Richtersveld to turn the once harsh landscape into a replenished ecosystem where life could flourish. Oz christened this land as a new home for No-Pats: Namaqualand and its borders would be open to everyone who seeked a place to call home.</p>
<p><strong>The balance of the world was restored…but for how long would it last?</strong></p>
