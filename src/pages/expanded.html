<h3 id="the-prologue">Journey of The No-Pats —</h3>
<p>Kayvan Bechir was a journalist born in Doha, Qatar. In 2040 he was actively surfing a darknet browser to research the issue of armed No-Pats and to try and get in contact with a soldier in their ranks. Luckily at 3:28 AM, after countless fakes prior, he got a direct message from someone claiming to be the commander of the largest contingent of No-Pat forces, known to the world simply as “Oz”. Due to the reputation of the No-Pat movement, he knew the police would come knocking any second. Kayvan knew he needed to flee.</p>
<p>Kayvan, now on the run, used the sand storm’s cover to keep out of sight from the armored vehicles hunting him down. Anomalies started to appear on the LED adverts that bled through the thick layer of sand, leaving him breadcrumbs to follow. Eventually he found himself in the catacombs under the abandoned football Stadium where Pyotr Guskovsky was waiting for him. Kayvan left his hometown behind him.</p>
<p>Two months pass and Kayvan finds himself in a safehouse in India filled with armed No-Pats. Amongst them were Specialist Navin Rao, the notorious hacker and ex-MARCOS officer. Him and the other armed No-Pats were preparing for a heist on the largest ship breaking yard - they needed a boat.</p>
