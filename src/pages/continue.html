<h3 id="year-2-the-battle-continues">CHAPTER 1 - BURIED SECRETS</h3>
<p>As <span class='highlightContinue' tooltip="epilogue_arkangel">Arkangel</span> and the Coalition flourish in their newfound alliance they move onto the next step, the next frontier. They start a new program of development focusing on experimental weaponry with the help from the legendary SULIS project’s research. This top-secret organization had operational bases scattered throughout the globe, but most notably one located in Halvøy, Norway which - now abandoned - experimented with bizarre “firestorm” machinery, using both British and German soldiers as test subjects during the second World War.</p>
<p>Arkangel formed a brigade that was tasked with safeguarding SULIS’ operational secrets - the Scion SFG. They couldn’t risk it falling into the hands of the West. The Scions operated in close proximity to the hottest temperature conditions on earth, so they were kitted with insulated and fireproof gear.</p>
<p>In March, 2049, Camila Blasco received a report from one of her Leviathan Division operatives named TRITON. TRITON’s unit had arrived at the, now abandoned, Nordvik facility in Lapland where they had found signs of other operatives on the site. These operatives are believed to be part of the Scion SFG since their thermal signatures were masked by their cooling material.</p>
<p>They eventually made their way to a secret subterranean level of the cube, previously used as part of Project: Silver Spear, where the Scions recovered a number of assets. Further analysis indicated this floor had been previously used as part of Project: Silver Spear and serial number found linked to the Hungarian scientist Dr. Gedeon Voros. Following the Scions’ trail, Triton ultimately lost them outside of Oslo. However, Triton managed to intercept the special forces group’s comms and learned they were revisiting the ancient Sulis site: Halvøy. Triton arrived too late as the trail went cold, they had gotten what they came for and quickly departed.</p>
<h3 id="year-2-the-battle-continues">CHAPTER 2 - REMOTE DEALINGS</h3>
<p>The secret mission to the EUSA facility that Mackay had been assigned to had shown great significance in the neverending conflict. As Mackay relays the information to Rao they realize that Arkangel was not only trying to carve a new future of warfare but also wake the dead in their path by reviving SULIS.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that those who passed SULIS’ infamous Firestorm trial were inducted into a special group known as the covenant. The purpose of this covenant remains unknown but there is reason to believe it was tied to an operation that never saw the light of day during World War two but was now picked up a century later by Arkangel.</p>
<p>With Arkangel’s recent compiling and uncovering of Sulis’ secrets they move on to kickstart the buried Operation: Sunbreaker. The operation is carried out by its members, who are responsible for live operations field testing of the program’s weapons, military equipment and gear. The experimental nature of the Sunbreakers program warrants a special waiver to be signed: death is all but a guarantee - but you’ll go out in a blaze of glory.</p>
<p>Following up on the incident tied to TRITON’s unit in Sweden, Blackburn orders both Scions and Sunbreakers to investigate the SULIS site in Halvøy to continue following the trail of  breadcrumbs left by past SULIS members. The technology they were after was essential in their global efforts. Once recovered the asset would be moved to a secret island, likely in Japan.</p>

<h3 id="year-2-the-battle-continues">CHAPTER 3 - RESISTANCE</h3>
<p>Born out of a coup earlier in the decade led by the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and Hamasaki Nayomi’s Nova Group, the Fūjin Ronin were made up of soldiers from all branches of the Japanese SDF who strongly opposed the Coalition’s foothold in Japan. The Fūjin Ronin have now chosen exile as they plan the retaking of their homeland - as well as being welcomed as a member of the Mandate of Nations ‘ armed forces.</p>
<p>The takeover of Japan was a strategic decision as it would serve as the place where Arkangel and the Coalition would continue the Sunbreaker operation. As Paik continued her deep dive into the lion’s den she found herself in Coalition occupied Japan, still following the orders of Valkyrie to infiltrate yet another secret site. The island was the target and Paik disguised herself fittingly, although worried that A.O.S would eventually cross reference her biometrics and find a match from Boreas. Valkyrie had promised an exit strategy after completion, she had to be swift.</p>
<p>March 2049, the Arkangel Legion Omega Company was escorting Project Sulis Operatives in Japan at 0400 when they were ambushed by the Fūjin Ronin. The Legion Commander, Mercer, counted their losses to twenty casualties and all six Ascension satellite telemetry stations.</p>
<p>Marking the third encounter with the seemingly exiled Fūjin Ronin this month, Mercer informed Blackburn of the Sovereign Conclave’s request for Arkangel to formally step in to address the problem. They now await Blackburn’s response.</p>
<h3 id="year-2-the-battle-continues">CHAPTER 4 - RISE AND FALL</h3>
<p>A New London was born when its crumbling state was saved by the Mandate of Nations as they began stitching Europe back together again. They wanted a capital to represent the Mandate&#39;s growth, and their call for aid brought many British No-Pats home, exchanging their fatigues for Mandate uniforms.</p>
<p>New London - built on the ashes of the old - was the first major city to open an embassy for Namaqualand, solidifying an alliance between the two coalitions. A lot of old, bad blood had been washed away, a testament to just how much this city has survived.</p>
<p>The Mandate’s defensive strategies continue to climb as they form a new special forces infiltration group operating under the Unconventional Warfare Division called SIG-OPs, Special Insertion Group Operations. They are responsible for reconnaissance, disruption and search and destroy, with their main purpose to throw the enemy off-balance and give their allies an advantage to charge in from behind - which is exactly what they were tasked to carry out for the Fūjin Ronin as they began their push to retake mainland Japan.</p>
<p>The Fūjin Ronin’s General Takahashi is as determined as the rest to take back what was once their home. The Mandate’s funding proved to be more than bountiful as more and more successful operations were carried out.</p>
<p>With this newfound alliance with the Mandate, at last their dream might come true.</p>
<h3 id="year-2-the-battle-continues">CHAPTER 5 - HORRORS OF THE PAST</h3>
<p>The conflicts in the east continue to brew. Arkangel takes advantage of the global disarray to further their interests and research into the old secrets of Sulis and their Covenant of Fire. This Covenant of Fire dates back to, at the very least, the 1940s. The victorious few who survived Project: Firestorm emerged with severe burns that scarred and disfigured their bodies beyond recognition.</p>
<p>In 1944, they were deployed during World War II to Bastogne, Belgium to save the American Troops stationed there but ultimately their goal was to bury Sulis’ secrets and safeguard them for the future. Word got around of these mysterious figures silently taking the battlefield and looming like ghosts and they became known as The Butchers of Bastogne. Their relentless carnage changed the tide of battle and the Americans somehow lived through the Circle of Hell.</p>
<p>Now, in 2049, Jonathan Michaels, seemingly an Arkangel operative, contacts Blackburn about their findings of long lost papers containing intel on the events at Bastogne in 1944. He informs Blackburn of the strange orders that the Americans received as The Butchers were deploying there. He says that they would bring “the strength of hell itself” and there were warnings of a cleansing fire. The last part of the orders seemed like they were scrawled in after the fact, perhaps by someone on the ground in Bastogne.</p>
<p>As a response to these findings, Sulis begins their work with Arkangel in earnest and the soldiers that have carried on the legacy of this Covenant return to Bastogne to unearth these long buried dark secrets. But they are not alone - Valkyrie informs Zain, Casper, Boris, Lis and Falck that she needs them to head to Bastogne to unearth Sulis’ secrets before they get there in an attempt to turn whatever weapon is buried there against them.</p>
<p>At Bastogne. Lis and Zain find a memo from the Germans with intel on human trials for a supposed  “weapon of prophecy”. The memo was from Lt. Col. Otto Bauer who was a German soldier with obvious ties to the Firestorm project. More intel reveals that a promising candidate had survived the trial but he was unrecognizable due to the flames, although the candidate didn’t seem to be bothered as he was fully devoted to the Covenant.</p>
<p>As the searching continues, Falck and Casper come across a letter with top secret intel that never left the battlefield. Its contents describe Michael’s, an American soldier,  perspective as The Butchers came to their aid during the Battle of The Bulge. They were wearing masks covering their damaged appearance, as they struck swiftly and saved the Americans from defeat. In the aftermath, the troops got curious about The Butchers although they wouldn’t let them near the crates they were guarding.</p>
<p>Later on, Zain and Boris find a report with intel on The Butchers of Bastogne. The report describes these looming ghosts tearing through the German troops and the battlefield itself as they leave mysterious rings of fire in their wake. Soldiers describe these Butchers:</p>
<ul>
<p><em>&quot;I wasn&#39;t watching men fight that night. I was watching demons.&quot;</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Falck and Lis also discover a Sulis marked crate containing schematics of their supposed weapon of prophecy. Falck’s reaction suggests that it is of great danger if Sulis were to acquire the schematics and she reports back to Valkyrie immediately.</p>
<p>The specialists continue their dig-up of the century old secrets hoping to uncover it before Sulis and Arkangel get their hands on it.</p>
