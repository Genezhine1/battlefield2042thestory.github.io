<h3 id="the-forever-war">The sewings of a bleak future —</h3>

<p>Everyone knew it was coming, sooner or later. Yet no one was prepared for what shape it would take. The rogue AI, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_aos">A.O.S</span>, has utilized the virus and found a weakness in the security of <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_blackburn">Blackburn</span>’s code taking command of a CENTRAL unit army. Project Pallas, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="dark_geist">geists</span>, the <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="dark_ascension">ascension network</span>, these CENTRAL units are what he’s been building towards all this time. We’re witnessing a calamity in real time and it’s the biggest threat since the infamous <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_blackout">blackout</span>.</p>
<p>The specialist <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_rao">Navin Rao</span> has encountered these CENTRAL units and sends word to <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_irish">Irish</span> of his analysis. They run off a similar blueprint that of the geists from Scotland but with one major difference. These CENTRAL units adapt, learn, and rewrite their data in realtime - much like normal soldiers. But these units lack compassion and empathy and all other human properties, making them fierce killing machines. Rao suggests they need to reach the source and stop A.O.S before it’s too late.</p>
<p>There are others on the battlefield noticing the severity of this threat - one group in particular: the <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="forever_aaas">Anti-Automaton Assault squadron</span>. Made up of soldiers, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_nopat">No-Pats</span> and former <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="dark_unit86">Unit-86</span> members led by <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="dark_zekkal">Leila Zekkal</span> they strike hard against the CENTRAL army and take up new teammates even if they used to be the enemy. The former captain of the <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_bcs">BCS</span>, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_campbell">Duncan Campbell</span>, is also present in their ranks being led by Zekkal.</p>
<p>Blackburn continues to play both sides but sooner or later he has to realize he’s way in over his head.</p>
