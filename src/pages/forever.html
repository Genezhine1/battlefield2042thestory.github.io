<h3 id="the-forever-war">Sewings of a bleak future —</h3>

<p>Everyone knew it was coming, sooner or later. Yet no one was prepared for what shape it would take. The rogue AI, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_aos">A.O.S</span>, has utilized the virus and found a weakness in the security of <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_blackburn">Blackburn</span>’s code taking command of a <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="forever_central">CENTRAL</span>, Coalition Enclave NanoTech Reinforced Automaton Line, unit army. Project Pallas, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="dark_geist">geists</span>, the <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="dark_ascension">ascension network</span>, these CENTRAL units are what he’s been building towards all this time. We’re witnessing a calamity in real time and it’s the biggest threat since the infamous <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_blackout">blackout</span>.</p>
<p>The specialist <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_rao">Navin Rao</span> has encountered these CENTRAL units and sends word to <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_irish">Irish</span> of his analysis. They run off a similar blueprint that of the geists from Scotland but with one major difference. These CENTRAL units adapt, learn, and rewrite their data in realtime - much like normal soldiers. But these units lack compassion and empathy and all other human properties, making them fierce killing machines. Rao suggests they need to reach the source and stop A.O.S before it’s too late.</p>
<p>There are others on the battlefield noticing the severity of this threat - one group in particular: <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="forever_unita3">Unit A3</span>, the Anti-Automaton Assault squadron. Made up of soldiers, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_nopat">No-Pats</span> and former <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="dark_unit86">Unit-86</span> members led by <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="dark_zekkal">Leila Zekkal</span> they strike hard against the CENTRAL army and take up new teammates even if they used to be the enemy. The former captain of the <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_bcs">BCS</span>, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_campbell">Duncan Campbell</span>, is also present in their ranks being led by Zekkal.</p>
<p>Blackburn continues to play both sides but sooner or later he has to realize he’s way in over his head.</p>

<h3 id="the-forever-war">Garments of a darkened world —</h3>

<p>The love child of Arkangel and <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="continue_sulis">Project Sulis</span>; the CENTRAL units. The killing machines tear through soldiers at rapid rates - with only a few who can counter. A.O.S deploys them at various regions across the globe starting with <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="epilogue_redacted">The Hebrides</span> in Scotland and the <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="prologue_exposure">Steadfast Refuge Operations center</span> in Canada. A.O.S carried out the final phase of her operation, <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="forever_warmachine">War Machine</span>, swift and calculated. Blackburn continues to desperately convince himself and his peers that he has control over the situation. After all, A.O.S was his creation and he could never accept the reality of her slipping through his fingers.</p>

<p>The CENTRAL units have become known as “Chimeras” to the common soldier. They are a hivemind directly operated by A.O.S. <span class='highlightForever' tooltip="zero_darkmarket">The Dark Market</span>’s collected data on the Exodus specialists serve as genetic profiling materials for the CENTRAL army, mimicking their combat style and roles. Rao has already witnessed this in real time.</p>

<p>Unit A3’s mission is in full effect and their motto “The only good AI is a dead AI.” echoes on the field of battle as they combat the CENTRAL army. Parallel to Irish who reflect on the years past and the dark reality of today.</p>

<p>This forever war he has been fighting since the beginning - he’ll keep fighting until the last bell rings.</p>
