<p>The world is changing rapidly. By 2028, total coastal devastation is taking place and farmland is tainted by climate change which leads innovators to look to the desert to make it arable. Global food production halves and relocates and by 2030, Baltic firestorms ravage through western Europe as entire farmlands are wiped out. 50% of global shipping ports shut down as a result of the rising sea levels. Eventually the Euro drops to 0.08 USD. The world </p>
<p>Entire nations are lost to history in just under a year. Europe’s most powerful state, Germany, dissolves on August 8th, 2035 and a month later the EU disbands. Following this, the official term Non-Patriated is coined by a joint international council that seeks to process and manage the refugees displaced by the European crisis. In 2037, the US and Russia superpowers awaken and clash in border conflicts and proxy wars across the earth. Meanwhile the US has been planning something big behind closed curtains.</p>
<p><span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_steadfast">Operation: Steadfast Refuge</span> was a US based military operation taking form in <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_exposure">Black Ridge</span>, Canada, in 2028 to battle the ongoing global environmental disasters and instability. The project’s goal was to create a solution that could rebalance the instability around the globe, that solution was <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_shearwater">Shearwater-1</span>.</p>
<p>Production came online in 2038 and was headed up by NARCOM, which stands for ‘North American Strategic Aerospace Command’, guised as a Canadian Air Force base to keep it under complete secrecy. The actual goal of this project was to protect and stabilize the weather in North America.</p>
<p>Production deadlines were shortened by American military forces as they were desperate to get this device into orbit ASAP. The man behind this science was <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_voros">Dr. Gedeon Voros</span>; an Hungarian scientist previously researching climate change and was renowned by many. He complied, even though he knew the repercussions this could have due to insufficient data and safety measures, and finished the project.</p>
<p>On March 12th, 2040, the device was launched into orbit. It had a deployment malfunction which took Shearwater-1</span> off course where it collided with a US satellite and caused a cascade that resulted in the <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_blackout">Blackout of 2040</span> where 50-70% of the world’s satellite network was destroyed. Voros was never blamed publicly but instead he defected from the project as he felt enormous guilt over his actions.</p>
<p>On September 12th, 2041, a journalist named <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_kayvan">Kayvan Bechir</span> is forced to leave his homeland, <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_hourglass">Doha</span>, and what follows would be an unprecedented <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_journey">journey with the No-Pats</span> as he would later board the <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_exodus">Exodus</span>. His global adventure with the No-Pats would educate him on their cause. When his journey would seemingly come to an end, fate had other plans. The <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_exodus">Exodus</span> was rerouted last minute by orders from a mysterious entity called ‘Oz’ - he had a new mission for them.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>Oz: Exodus, what&#39;s your location?</em></p>
<p><em>Exodus: We are 637 north 1510 west, sir.</em></p>
<p><em>Oz: Revise course immediately. Chart your heading to 4933 north 710 west, push to full power.</em></p>
<p><em>Exodus: But sir, we&#39;re just 12 hours to-</em></p>
<p><em>Oz: I&#39;m aware of what I&#39;m ordering you to do, Exodus. There&#39;s a new mission.</em></p>
<p><em>Exodus: Sir, with all due respect we are black on rations with 200 starving refugees below deck, the captain has ordered us to-</em></p>
<p><em>Oz: You tell the captain to change course now. We have one shot to a new future, we&#39;re going to take it.</em></p>
</ul>
<p>The damaged <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_shearwater">Shearwater-1</span> satellite remained in orbit until October 20th, 2042 where it started its crash trajectory to <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_hourglass">Doha, Qatar</span>. Now, the <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_exodus">Exodus</span>, captained by <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_irish">Kimble “Irish” Graves</span>, was heading to London to retrieve intel for Oz that held valuable data linking to the US’ involvement in the catastrophic <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_blackout">Blackout</span>. Irish eventually retrieved the intel but a change of mind, thanks to his old squadmate Clayton “Pac” Pakowski’s worrying comments about Oz, which were eventually proven to be true as <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_rao">Navin Rao</span> handed Irish the classified intel stating that the satellite, <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_shearwater">Shearwater-1</span>, was going to crash in <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_hourglass">Doha</span> in 36 hours and the US was trying to cover up their secret.</p>
<p>Irish went “rogue” and withheld the intel from Oz which sparked a conflict in the <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_prelude">Mediterranean Sea</span>. The fight didn&#39;t last for long as two of Oz&#39;s condors were quickly dealt with thanks to the category 5 “Omega” storm which Irish decided to head straight into to give them “home field advantage”. The fight culminated into a hostage situation where Irish’s son, Omar, acted as leverage for the intel. Irish gave in and handed over the intel to Oz’s accomplice on the deck but he didn’t hold his promise and was about to execute his son. Thanks to Pac, this reality never came to be, as he killed the accomplice and set Omar free to reunite with his father. The last condor was destroyed and Irish cut ties with Oz as he headed to the bridge to send out a global message:</p>
<ul>
<p><em>There is only one way to stop this war, and that is to get in the middle of it. Put a call out to any No-Pat who will listen; 36 hours to Doha, get ready to fight!</em></p>
</ul>
<p>The Superpowers tipped over as they commenced all-out-warfare over the retrieval of the <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_shearwater">Shearwater</span> satellite in <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_hourglass">Doha</span>. The ripples would be felt across the globe as full scale battles ensued.</p>
<p>On October 28th, 2042, a respected journalist named <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_mithali">Mithali Reed</span> reported on a leak about a firefight in Gorlitz the previous night. A dropped satellite capsule containing valuable data was being contested in the town. No-Pat, <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_lis">Ewelina Lis</span> and her squadmates successfully managed to pocket the data from the capsule belonging to the US. The intel was linked to the US operation <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_steadfast">Steadfast Refuge</span>. With a motive of revenge for the <span class='highlight' tooltip="prologue_blackout">Blackout</span>, which caused the death of her previous unit, Lis would later travel to the base of operations to destroy it. But she wasn’t the only one with eyes on the secretive facility.</p>
