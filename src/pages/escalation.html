<p>The Shearwater package had been picked up in French Guiana and transported to a <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_nordvik">Nordvik</span> facility by a previously known <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_nopat">No-Pat</span>, <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="master_blasco">Camila Blasco</span> of the Impávido. They were aided by her battleship during <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="master_wildcard">Operation: Wildcard</span> but were unaware of her involvement in project Silver Spear at that moment. Blasco had picked up the package at the launch site for <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span>, after he had made a deal earlier with the <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="zero_darkmarket">Dark Market</span> to retrieve the processors for him at <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_exposure">Black Ridge</span>.</p>
<p>Blasco traveled the waters and eventually made port in Northern Sweden and delivered the package to Oz’s trusted accomplice <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_zain">Rasheed Zain</span>. She returned to her ship where it was docked and remained there for a few weeks, meanwhile Zain ensured the assets came to use.</p>
<p>On February 27th, 2043 at 17:00, <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_exodus">The Exodus</span> gets a last ping of the Silver Spear package which leads them to a remote factory in <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_spearhead">Lappland, Sweden</span>. The neutral Nordvik organization founded in 2028, by Måns Nordqvist, Erik Nilsson, and <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_bergman">Oscar Bergman</span>, was the company who had built these factories in Northern Sweden initially aimed to produce agricultural equipment. Their ambitions exceeded the agroindustry and by 2034, as the <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_collapse">EU collapsed</span>, they shifted their production to serve the military industrial complex and 80% of their operations were now dedicated to military production.</p>
<p>On March 3rd, 2043, <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="zero_wolff">Wolff</span> informed Dir. Renoit of the situation in Sweden and Oz’s production of Silver Spear which, in his hands, would act as a weapon. The scientist <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_voros">Voros</span>, who helped in the production of <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_shearwater">Shearwater-1</span>, has been helping Oz after getting a second chance to fully develop this device. Wolff requests the immediate approval of <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_warmachine">Operation: War Machine</span> to destroy the device before it reaches completion.</p>
<p>Wolff knows of Zain’s ability to rally the No-Pats and fears he might attempt to manipulate The Exodus crew into aligning with him and Oz’s movement - if this were the case the results would be catastrophic for Wolff and the American military.</p>
<p>On March 14th, 2043 at 13:00, Operation: War Machine commences and the Exodus gains approved entry by Nordvik, thanks to their secretive partnership with the US, to move in on the subterranean floor where the Silver Spear technology was being developed - in tandem with the United States rollout of US forces to combat the approaching Eastern threat.</p>
<p>Under the command of Wolff, the Exodus fireteam, containing <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="zero_crawford">Crawford</span>, <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_lis">Lis</span>, <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="zero_casper">Casper</span>, <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="zero_dozer">Dozer</span>, <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_rao">Rao</span> and <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="zero_mackay">Mackay</span>, infiltrates the facility. They encounter Zain and a verbal conflict ensues. Zain eventually gets the opportunity to tell everyone that Oz is not building a weapon and removes the paint from Wolff’s facade as he warns them that he is not to be trusted.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>I know why you’re here. You believe Project: Silver Spear is a weapon. That’s a lie. Wolff cannot be trusted. He’s using you, and will stop at nothing to kill Oz. I’ll prove it to you. Activate the transmitters. Oz planted a special signal beacon at this facility.</em></p>
<p><em>When activated, a GPS tied to his personal codes will falsify his location tag. Wolff will think you’ve found Oz and bomb what he believes is your location. You’ll see that, to him, you are nothing more than collateral damage. <br>- Zain</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Zain succeeded in swaying the Exodus No-Pats and they followed Zain’s instructions to prove his claims: activate the transmitters located around the Nordvik facility. As they activated the transmitters Wolff got falsified information of the location of Oz and launched a missile barrage that damaged the facility.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>No hard feelings, Exodus. As it stands, No-Pats fall under “acceptable losses” if we toe-tag Oz in the process. Know that your sacrifice has saved the free world. You can take that to your graves. <br>- Wolff</em></p>
</ul>
<p>The Exodus was finally shown Wolff’s true face as he was willing to sacrifice the No-Pats lives just to take down Oz, and with their newfound knowledge of the truth; they now found themselves aligned to Oz’s cause.</p>
<p>Zain, with the help of Caju, gave them safe passage to port as they couldn’t go back to the ship now that Wolff knew of their betrayal. They made their way to the <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_manifest">port in Singapore</span> to retrieve a laptop that was stored in a container, thanks to the Dark Market, containing everything on Project: Silver Spear. The Exodus No-Pats were ensured the data would turn the tide of the fight in their favor, but in Wolff’s hands it would destroy them.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>The Dark Market gave Oz a storage container here. It has everything on Project: Silver Spear. You just need to unlock it. Project: Silver Spear was never a weapon. It’s our future. The Shearwater technology.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Voros fixed the coding mistakes and unlocked its full potential: a geoengineering machine, one that could transform the land and build us a new home.</em></p>
<p><em>This has been our plan. To create a place to unite us, the abandoned and forgotten: the No-Pats. Oz's laptop has everything. In Wolff’s hands, it would destroy us. But in yours, we can turn the tide of our fight. <br>- Zain</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Blasco conversed with one of the founders Oscar Bergman for a while where she learned that he had provided false information for the CIA of the Exodus’ heading. This meant that the Exodus could finally depart with Blasco and the Impávido escorting them and they were to link up again with the Exodus fireteam in Singapore. After, the Impávido departs elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Exodus fireteam recovers the Silver Spear data in Singapore and Oz comes over comms and tells them that Wolff’s goal was never for the betterment of the world but revenge. He apologizes to <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="prologue_irish">Irish</span> for his previous mistakes but encourages them to follow him to pave the road for a new and better future for the No-Pats. Together they would finish what they started, the next step would be to realign the Shearwater-2 satellite, previously launched in the <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_orbital">French Guiana</span> by the Dark Market as Oz and the <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="master_broker">Broker</span> watched, which would lead them back to Black Ridge where Voros had installed a special Satellite Control switch.</p>
<ul>
<p><em>So now you know the truth. Wolff will destroy the future I'm building for the No-Pats at any cost. It's not about nations or superpowers – it's about revenge. Exodus... Irish: I can't change what I've done, but perhaps now you understand why. Let us finish what we started. Together. Help me bring Silver Spear online. Return to where Voros’ work began. <br>- Oz</em></p>
</ul>
<p>They initiate realignment and are now declared an enemy of the United States and her allies according to Wolff as he threatens The Exodus to hunt them down. Zain leads The Exodus to a safe place in <span class='highlightEscalation' tooltip="escalation_breakaway">Queen Maud land</span> in Antarctica. There they would make contact with Oz through a secure comms device and request immediate exfil to his base of operations. The comms device is activated and Zain connects with Oz:</p>
<ul>
<p><em>Eden-1, this is Sentry Sierra, request emergency exfil. Eden-1, do you copy? “There is a star that will lead us home.” <br>- Zain</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Oz responds quickly thereafter:</p>
<ul>
<p><em>“And that star will brighten your way home.” Good to hear your voice, old friend. Exodus: the Impávido is inbound for escort to Eden-1. I look forward to your arrival. A new world is waiting for all of us, but Wolff will make us fight for it. Welcome to the real war. <br>- Oz</em></p>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oz’s plot reaches the Eleventh Hour and so do his adversaries…</strong></p>
