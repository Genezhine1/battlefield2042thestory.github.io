<p>In 2048, the elite PMC <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_nova">Nova Group</span> led by <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_hamada">General Hamada</span>, with ties to a secretive alliance in Greater Asia, had seized control of an important trade route in <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_reclaimed">Zlín, Czechia</span>. This route was used to transport vital assets for the Eastern Forces to aid in their war effort. This has sparked a conflict with the local militia as they battle for a foothold in the region.</p>
<p>The local militia, the <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_moravian">Moravian Guard</span>, had been battling the Eastern Forces push into Czechia for years. Moving into the wilderness they waged a guerrilla-style campaign, by many they were seen as savages based on their combat tactics. The operation for the Moravian Guard to take back control of the region was secretly funded by the US.</p>
<p>Colonel Greenland, of the US military, orders the reformed <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_tombstone">Tombstone Squad</span>, containing <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="zero_falck">Falck</span>, <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="zero_boris">Boris</span>, <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="zero_dozer">Dozer</span> and <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="zero_casper">Casper</span>, to fly in and link up with the Moravian Guard to locate the source of the encrypted transmission. Falck was hesitant on joining in at first but only before a voice hacked her comms, promising her she would find answers of her missing son David there - Falck answered the call. They deployed into Zlín and joined <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_brozik">Major Brozik</span> and the Moravian Guard.</p>
<p>The Guard and Tombstone moved in, as they set up a deal: Tombstone would help them sabotage the train route in exchange for the transmission intel. They accepted and moved in to blow up the tracks unknowing of an incoming shipment. The hit caused a derailment that put sensitive <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="epilogue_arkangel">Arkangel</span> cargo out in the open.</p>
<p>The Moravian Guard held their promise as they gave Tombstone Squad the transmission intel. The transmission was then decoded by Casper revealing a message:</p>
<ul>
<p><em>Irish, if you&#39;re out there, we need your help. <br>- Valkyrie</em></p>
</ul>
<p>The voice was from a mysterious person called <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_valkyrie">Valkyrie</span>, but Falck didn&#39;t recognize the voice but prayed <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="prologue_irish">Irish</span> would.</p>
<p>The conflict gains momentum as the US and their forces converge as the Eastern forces launch their own attack to take back control of the trade route - thus the <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_battlezlin">Battle of Zlín</span> commenced.</p>
<p>On March 15th, 2048, Arkangel was quickly working on securing and retrieving the assets in the area with their deployment of the private military arm <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_arklegion">Arkangel Legion</span> alongside the rollout of the new program that would aid their research at <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="epilogue_boreas">Boreas</span>; the <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="dawn_asn">Ascension Satellite Network</span>, ASN.</p>
<p>The Legion, fitted with cutting-edge technology, would deploy with telemetry data sensors across the globe with the goal to collect battle information. This information would be used in evolving the synthetic soldiers fighting capabilities even further. The ASN rollout at Zlín was used as a testbed before the global deployment later on, as it proved successful.</p>
<p>By March 22nd, 2048, the ASN had been launched around the globe as the Arkangel Legion deployed across multiple conflict zones. The technology was shared with both the West and East to maintain neutrality on the global stage but also to vastly increase the data yield. The Legion soldiers present in Zlín are still working on securing the derailed shipment.</p>
<p>Eventually, sometime after September 2048, Valkyrie started Tombstone Squad’s initiation which sent them to the desert to find a laptop mysteriously left by <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="zero_paik">Paik</span> containing documentation and files which they delivered to the contact. It contained sensitive data on Arkangel’s dealings behind the scenes. The next step instructs them to destroy an Arkangel satellite preparing for launch, but they hesitate. Falck was concerned if this was the right path, but her desperate chase for answers outweighed and they destroyed the satellite.</p>
<p>They had one last step to prove worthy; personal assignments to show their will to the cause - and they did not disappoint. Tombstone Squad was recruited into the ranks of the contact’s mysterious organization. They also ensure Falck that her participation is not in vain:</p>

<ul>
<p><em>You don’t know me, Falck, but I know you. I sent the message that lured you to Czechia.</em> </p>
<p><em>But it wasn’t a false flag, I promise. I do have information about David.</em></p>
<p><em>He is alive, I can say that much. But as for the rest… it has to wait. I’m sorry. <br>- Valkyrie</em></p>
</ul>
<p>This contact, calling themselves Valkyrie, had ordered Paik prior to Tombstone’s tasks to go to the <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="epilogue_redacted">Scottish Hebrides</span>. There she infiltrated the secret Boreas lab and dug up the truth of these missing <span class='highlightDawn' tooltip="prologue_nopat">No-Pat</span> cases. A phrase kept repeating in Valkyrie’s head:</p>
<p><strong>His Dark Creations will end us all…</strong></p>
