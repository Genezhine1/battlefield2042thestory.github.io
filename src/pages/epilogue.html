<p>The victory at the <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="eleven_flashpoint">Richtersveld</span> and the activation of the Shearwater-2 satellite on November 15th, 2043, was celebrated as <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_renewalday">Renewal Day</span>. <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="prologue_exodus">The Exodus</span> was decommissioned following the victory and The Exodus <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="prologue_nopat">No-Pats</span> were discharged. The US and Russia however didn’t cease their attacks as multiple No-Pat strongholds around the world were being assaulted.</p>
<p>Some of The Exodus No-Pats stayed in <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="eleven_namaqualand">Namaqualand</span> as others ventured elsewhere. <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="zero_boris">Boris</span> returns back to his home in Siberia, <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="zero_dozer">Dozer</span> picks up work at the <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_erf">European Recovery Foundation</span> performing executive security.</p>
<p><span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span> continued to deal with the <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="zero_darkmarket">Dark Market</span> as he gave them access to the Silver Spear satellites in exchange for cash and to maintain supply lines to the region. The Dark Market continued the Silver Spear project and restored multiple regions back to flourishing landscapes, however, as they held full authority over the project and where it would be used some regions were purposely ignored as they found no profitable reason to invest. The repercussions of these actions were yet to be seen.</p>
<p>As the Dark Market laid the foundation of the continued rollout of the Silver Spear project, <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="master_council">The Council</span> knew they had to evolve. A neutral entity to spearhead the project was necessary. <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_arkangel">Arkangel</span> was founded.</p>
<p>Arkangel Corporation, founded in early 2044, is focused on the development of robotics and AI with its founder and CEO, <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_blackburn">Henry Blackburn</span>, taking the helm. The Silver Spear satellite project was now officially run under Arkangel as they exceeded expectations with its accelerated use to regenerate environments globally.</p>
<p>The increasing demand of Shearwater satellites led them to establish the <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_sli">Shearwater Lithium Industries</span>. Over the following year they expanded operations as they built up stations in Australia, Argentina, Canada and Chile. Each of these countries were granted compensation in return for Arkangel’s right to mine. The ecological effects that these stations caused were subject to controversy. In an attempt to mollify the situation, Arkangel shutdown SLI facilities in numerous regions and instead used shell companies to build up new ones - this worked in most cases - and they kept thriving off the lithium.</p>
<p>In late 2044 Arkangel acquired the <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_boreas">Boreas</span> R&D lab, acquired in 2038 by Erik Nilsson, in the <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_redacted">Scottish Hebrides</span> with Blackburn as overseer. The development prior to Arkangel’s purchase had yielded unimpressive results with the synthetic soldier development led by Erik Nilsson. Blackburn restructured and decided that the best way for the production to be fruitful was to start using live human subjects. So as Blackburn took full control of Boreas, Project: Pallas was launched.</p>
<p>The live subjects were made up of captured <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="prologue_nopat">No-Pats</span> from around the globe. The extraction and enrollment of these subjects was handled by <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_bcs">Boreas Containment Services</span>, and its captain <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_campbell">Duncan Campbell</span>. The public started noticing these disappearances of No-Pats in 2045 but the concerns were often subdued by the European Recovery Foundation.</p>
<p>The human subjects proved successful in Project: Pallas’ development. Blackburn knew he needed an advanced AI to control and maintain these synthetic soldiers…</p>
<ul>
<p><em>I protect Boreas. I create our future.</em></p>
</ul>
<p>…<span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_aos">A.O.S</span> was born.</p>
<p>In 2045, Arkangel’s recruitment initiative accelerated as videos, from their Arkangel Public Network Broadcast, were released glorifying the company’s goals and achievements for the last couple of years, some would call it propaganda. But Arkangel’s - Blackburn’s - powerful words certainly stuck with the public:</p>
<ul>
<p><em>My name is Henry Blackburn, CEO and founder of Arkangel.</em></p>
<p><em>Whether it be as a decorated soldier for my country or running a best-in-class PMO, everything I’ve done in my life has been to serve others.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s still my mission here at Arkangel. Through the application of robotics and AI technologies I will help humanity and ensure we reach our full potential.</em></p>
<p><em>Progressio in pace. Ascensio in bello. In peace, evolution. In war, ascension. <br>- Blackburn</em></p>
</ul>
<p>Later that year Arkangel pushed for Boreas’ campaign as new recruitment videos were released to the public to increase the workforce and to maintain their positive public image:</p>
<ul>
<p><em>Arkangel leads the world in its development of robotics and AI, which wouldn’t be possible without Boreas Research &amp; Development.</em></p>
<p><em>Their advanced prosthetics program has changed the lives of thousands of injured soldiers and is now helping countless civilians across the globe.</em></p>
<p><em>While still in its infancy, their work on cybernetic augmentation is expanding the relationship between humans and machines to new heights.</em></p>
<p><em>The next phase in humanity’s evolution awaits. Arkangel is proud to guide us there. <br>- Blackburn</em></p>
</ul>
<p>In 2046, Arkangel’s success in its continued funding of Boreas’ R&D proved to the public that the corporation was more than capable of leading the world into a bright future. Since its founding, the prosthetics program at Boreas has helped thousands of civilians and soldiers recover from years of war. Arkangel pushed this program even further with their <span class='highlightEpilogue' tooltip="epilogue_reborn">Warrior’s Reborn initiative</span>.</p>
<p>During Arkangel’s years of rise on the global market, the consequences of the denial of the Silver Spear program to certain regions were brewing. America continues to deal with their exposure; they are isolated, their dominance on the global stage is crumbling as eastern regions are forming a secret alliance - they would reveal themselves when ready.</p>
