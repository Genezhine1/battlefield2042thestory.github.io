<p>In December, 2042, an attack was led by a <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_darkmarket">Dark Market</span> operative, <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_crawford">Charlie Crawford</span>, and the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_liquidators">Liquidators</span> on the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_steadfast">Steadfast Refuge</span> site to collect valuable data and assets on <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_steadfast">Operation: Steadfast Refuge</span> in the server rooms containing processors to be used for Project Silver Spear, spearheaded by <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span>, with the goal to succeed where the American led <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_shearwater">Shearwater-1</span> failed. Crawford and his team retrieved the assets successfully and during their exit they rigged explosives around the facility to destroy all evidence. Shortly thereafter they headed back to the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_darkmarket">Dark Market</span> base situated in the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_stranded">Panama Canal</span> for the assets to be handed over.</p>
<p><span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_wolff">Noah Wolff</span>, CIA and a former ally to <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span>, was out for revenge after one key event where <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span> got several of his men killed after finding out he was CIA. This meant his personal grudge led him to aim for total sabotage over Project Silver Spear. He was backed by the US military and held extensive communications with CIA Dir. M. Renoit.</p>
<p><span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_wolff">Wolff</span>’s goal was to lead a force to track down <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span> and stop him. This led him to tracking down the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_exodus">Exodus</span> and <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_irish">Irish</span>’s crew to recruit them as he knew they also had had unfortunate dealings with the “terrorist” known as <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span>. He also had intel on the Non-Patriated specialist <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_lis">Ewelina Lis</span>, who had extensive knowledge of the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_darkmarket">Dark Market</span>, to be amongst the Exodus crew:</p>
<p>Captain <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_irish">Kimble “Irish” Graves</span>, Field Medic <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_falck">Maria Falck</span>, Tech <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_rao">Navin Rao</span>, Engineer <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_angel">Constantin “Angel” Anghel</span>, Spy <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_paik">Ji-Soo Paik</span>, Weapons expert <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_boris">Pyotr “Boris” Guskovsky</span>, Gunsmith <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_dozer">Santiago “Dozer” Espinoza</span>, Survivalist <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_mackay">Webster Mackay</span>, Sniper <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_casper">Wikus “Casper” Van Daele</span> and Skydiver <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_sundance">Emma “Sundance” Rosier</span>.</p>
<p><span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_lis">Ewelina Lis</span>, former GROM member, reconnected with her old friend, <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_angel">Angel</span>, and heard about the Exodus’ hunt for <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span>. She learned of his dealings with the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_darkmarket">Dark Market</span> and the sabotage and mission at <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_exposure">Black Ridge</span> to steal assets for a weapon. This eventually led her to join the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_exodus">Exodus</span> and they headed for <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_exposure">Black Ridge</span> to destroy the facility.</p>
<p>This led them to find out they were not the first ones to land. A crew had arrived before they could, and that was <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_crawford">Crawford</span>’s crew. They recuperated and ultimately aligned themselves with <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_wolff">Wolff</span>’s agenda.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the explosives set by <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_crawford">Crawford</span> and the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_liquidators">Liquidators</span> prior had caused a landslide that exposed the facility’s existence to the Eastern Forces. US Forces were wrongly informed that the landslide was caused by Russia which led to both superpowers clashing at the facility.</p>
<p>On December 15th, the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_exodus">Exodus</span> intercepted a transmission from <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_crawford">Crawford</span> claiming to have a lead on <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_oz">Oz</span>. <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="prologue_lis">Lis</span> verified his connections to the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_darkmarket">Dark Market</span>. This made <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_crawford">Crawford</span> their primary target and they traced his location to Panama, specifically their operations hub which was set up inside the <span class='highlightZero' tooltip="zero_stranded">stranded STG Ceres freighter in Gatun Lake</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The Exodus sails south with the Master of Arms as their target…</strong></p>
