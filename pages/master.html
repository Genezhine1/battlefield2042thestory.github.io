<p>They set course for Panama and this operation, headed by Wolff, was to be called Operation: Wildcard, in tandem with the US Operation: Drydock. They needed all hands on deck for this one.</p>
<p>On January 25th, 2043 at 10:30, they reached the Panama Coast but were intercepted by several attacking vessels. After battling for a while, at 11:15, an unexpected ally appears as the Impávido captained by No-Pat Camila Blasco outguns the enemy and they disperse. Blasco then informs the Exodus of the presence of Russian enemy forces in the area as they were informed of US forces seizing control of the region which they wouldn’t allow to happen. Once the pirates were dealt with, the Impávido departed from the area. Blasco’s reason for being present in the area, and involved in project Silver Spear, would later be revealed..</p>
<p>At <strong>12:35</strong>, the Exodus manages to reach port and a fireteam, containing Angel, Falck, Mackay, Boris, Paik and Dozer, proceeds on foot to the STG Ceres. At <strong>14:00</strong>, they infiltrated and posed as weapons buyers for the Dark Market Broker, who worked under the Council. The Council led the Dark Market and was made up of three members, the Jaguar, the Dragon and the Sparrow. The fireteam’s cover is quickly blown as a firefight breaks out with the Liquidators, commanded by their founder Francisco Santos Batista. At <strong>14:10</strong>, US forces converge on Gatun Lake and the Ceres as Operation: Drydock commences. At <strong>14:15</strong>, Crawford comes to aid the Exodus fireteam and they take down the Liquidators but the Broker manages to escape unscathed.</p>
<p>Crawford secures a hovercraft for extraction and the fireteam follows and they head back to the Exodus. At <strong>16:00</strong>, they land and take Crawford into custody as they move into safer waters away from the ongoing Battle of Gatun Lake.</p>
<p>Following the collapse of the Dark Market’s Gatun Lake operation. The Dragon estimated a profit loss in the hundreds of millions, not to mention the disappearance of the Sparrow’s prized prisoner, Crawford. Blame for the disastrous incident was placed squarely on The Liquidators and Batista. He was later informed he would “voluntarily” step down and be cut off from the Dark Market. Exiled. In a rare moment of sympathy, the Jaguar provided Batista with the idea, and start-up capital, to form his own mercenary company.</p>
<p>Wolff visits the Exodus as he confronts and interrogates Crawford. He reveals to Wolff that what he has seen leads him to believe that Oz is building a weapon - as they suspected. As Crawford’s suspicions grew earlier he tells Wolff that he had encoded tracking software to the package so the possibility to find it was now viable. Following this the Exodus was tasked to decipher the package to find out where it was headed. </p>
<ul>
<p><em>CRAWFORD: Oz made a deal with the devil: The Dark Market. He paid them to steal the Steadfast Refuge tech from Black Ridge. I’d know, I led the job. Your CIA man, Wolff? He’s right about one thing. That tech caused the Blackout – in the wrong hands, no telling what it could do. It’ll be in Oz&#39;s hands soon. We just need to know where.</em></p>
<p>Crawford and the Exodus manage to put it together. The signal pings an old EUSA substation in French Guiana and they head there only to find the package had been picked up by someone else prior. The next ping leads them to the site of a Synseco facility in Egypt, but nothing was found. This wild goose chase would eventually turn fruitful as the last ping finally leads them on the right track.</p>
<p><em>CRAWFORD: Oz cut a deal with another Dark Market partner. Nordvik. Yeah, the manufacturer turned military contractor that supplies America with &quot;tomorrow&#39;s war machines.&quot; Railgun tech. Next level shit. Word is he&#39;s building his weapon at one of their sites. He&#39;s tasked a loyal ally to oversee the op. A real hardliner.</em></p>
<p>They receive a code from an incoming mysterious transmission.</p>
<p><em>TRANSMISSION: Eight. Nine. Zero. Three.</em></p>
<p><em>CRAWFORD: Assemble the code and we find the facility. I think it’s time we ask that hardliner some fucking questions.</em></p>
</ul>
<p><strong>War reaches an Escalation as the Exodus confronts a hardliner…</strong></p>
