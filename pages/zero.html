<p>In December, 2042, an attack was led by a Dark Market operative, Charlie Crawford, and the Liquidators, Dark Market’s private militia, on the Steadfast Refuge site to collect valuable data and assets on Operation: Steadfast Refuge in the server rooms containing processors to be used for Project Silver Spear, spearheaded by Oz, with the goal to succeed where the American led Shearwater-1 failed. Crawford and his team retrieved the assets successfully and during their exit they rigged explosives around the facility to destroy all evidence. Shortly thereafter they headed back to the Dark Market base situated in the Panama Canal for the assets to be handed over.</p>
<p>Noah Wolff, CIA and a former ally to Oz, was out for revenge after one key event where Oz got several of his men killed after finding out he was CIA. This meant his personal grudge led him to aim for total sabotage over Project Silver Spear. He was backed by the US military and held extensive communications with CIA Dir. M. Renoit.</p>
<p>Wolff’s goal was to lead a force to track down Oz and stop him. This led him to tracking down the Exodus and Irish’s crew to recruit them as he knew they also had had unfortunate dealings with the “terrorist” known as Oz. He also had intel on the Non-Patriated specialist Ewelina Lis, who had extensive knowledge of the Dark Market, to be amongst the Exodus crew:</p>
<p>Captain Kimble “Irish” Graves, Field Medic Maria Falck, Tech Navin Rao, Engineer Constantin “Angel” Anghel, Spy Ji-Soo Paik, Weapons expert Pyotr “Boris” Guskovsky, Gunsmith Santiago “Dozer” Espinoza, Survivalist Webster Mackay, Sniper Wikus “Casper” Van Daele and Skydiver Emma “Sundance” Rosier.</p>
<p>Ewelina Lis, former GROM member, reconnected with her old friend, Constantine “Angel” Anghel, and heard about the Exodus’ hunt for Oz. She learned of his dealings with the Dark Market and the sabotage and mission at Black Ridge to steal assets for a weapon. This eventually led her to join the Exodus and they headed for Black Ridge to destroy the facility.</p>
<p>This led them to find out they were not the first ones to land. A crew had arrived before they could, and that was Crawford’s crew. They recuperated and ultimately aligned themselves with Wolff’s agenda.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the explosives set by Crawford and the Liquidators prior had caused a landslide that exposed the facility’s existence to the Eastern Forces. US Forces were wrongly informed that the landslide was caused by Russia which led to both superpowers clashing at the facility.</p>
<p>On December 15th, the Exodus intercepted a transmission from Crawford claiming to have a lead on Oz. Lis verified his connections to the Dark Market. This made Crawford their primary target and they traced his location to Panama, specifically their operations hub which was set up inside the stranded STG Ceres freighter in Gatun Lake.</p>
<p><strong>The Exodus sails south with the Master of Arms as their target…</strong></p>
